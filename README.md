# RemaPy Explorer

RemaPy is an open source file explorer for your reMarkable tablet. You can upload documents via copy and paste from your local file explorer, open notebooks and annotated pdfs and delete documents or collections. RemaPy is written in Python and only tested on Linux,
altough it should (theoretically) also work on other systems. Feel free to 
write an issue if you find a bug or also if you have an idea for new features. 
Details (How to install, architecture FAQ etc.) can be found in the 
[wiki](https://github.com/peerdavid/remapy/wiki).
