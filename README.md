# RemaPy Explorer

RemaPy is an open source file explorer for your reMarkable tablet. You can upload documents via copy and paste from your local file explorer, open notebooks and annotated pdfs and delete documents or collections. RemaPy is written in python and only tested on Linux, altough it should (theoretically) also work on other operating systems such as windows. Feel free to write an issue if you find a bug or also if you have an idea for new features. 

*Note: Details such as how to install, the software architecture or FAQ's can be found in the 
[wiki](https://github.com/peerdavid/remapy/wiki).*
